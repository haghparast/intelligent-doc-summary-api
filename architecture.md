# Intelligent Document Summarization API - Architecture Document

## Overview
The **Intelligent Document Summarization API** is designed to allow users to upload documents, generate summaries using OpenAI's language models, and manage their documents and summaries. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, design decisions, and how the various components interact.

## System Architecture

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication:** Users authenticate using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon registration or login, a JWT is issued and must be included in the `Authorization` header of requests that require authentication.
- **Authorization:** Middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access routes that involve document upload, retrieval, and summarization. The JWT is verified to identify the user and grant access to their resources.

### 2. Document Management
- **File Upload:** Users can upload documents in PDF, DOCX, or TXT formats using Multer, a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files.
- **Storage:** Uploaded documents are temporarily stored on the server, and their content is extracted and saved in the MongoDB database associated with the user who uploaded them.

### 3. Document Summarization
- **OpenAI API Integration:** The document content is sent to OpenAI's API to generate a summary. This is done through the `/summarize` endpoint, which uses Axios to make a POST request to OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
- **Summary Storage:** The summary returned by OpenAI is stored in the database alongside the original document content.

### 4. Data Validation and Error Handling
- **Validation:** Input validation is performed using Joi to ensure that all user inputs (e.g., during registration or document upload) are valid and properly formatted.
- **Error Handling:** A global error handling middleware is implemented to catch and respond to errors consistently. This includes handling issues such as invalid file formats, authentication errors, and OpenAI API failures.

### 5. Database Design
- **User Schema:** Contains fields for username, email, and password. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored.
- **Document Schema:** Contains fields for the filename, user reference, document content, and generated summary. Each document is linked to a specific user, ensuring that users can only access their own documents and summaries.

### 6. API Routes
- **Authentication Routes:** Handle user registration and login. These routes are public and do not require authentication.
- **Document Routes:** Handle document upload and retrieval. These routes are protected and require the user to be authenticated.
- **Summary Routes:** Handle document summarization. These routes are also protected and interact with the OpenAI API.

### 7. Testing
- **Unit and Integration Testing:** The API is tested using Jest and Supertest. Tests cover user authentication, document upload, and summarization functionalities to ensure that all components work as expected.

## Design Decisions
- **JWT for Authentication:** JWTs were chosen for stateless authentication, allowing for easy scalability and secure user sessions.
- **Multer for File Uploads:** Multer was selected for its ease of use in handling file uploads in Express.js applications.
- **OpenAI API Integration:** OpenAI's API provides a powerful and flexible way to generate text summaries, making it ideal for this use case.

## Future Enhancements
- **Batch Summarization:** Implement the ability for users to upload multiple documents and receive summaries for all in one request.
- **Summary Comparison:** Provide users with the ability to compare summaries of different documents to identify similarities or differences.

## Conclusion
The **Intelligent Document Summarization API** is a robust solution for managing and summarizing documents using OpenAI's language models. The architecture is designed with scalability and security in mind, ensuring that users can securely manage their documents and generate summaries efficiently.
